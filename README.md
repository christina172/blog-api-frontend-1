# blog-api-frontend-1
Frontend-1 for Blog API Project (The Odin Project, JavaScript Path, Node.js Course, APIs)

This is the first front end for the blog api. The site consists of two pages and has a simple, but responsive design (the project is focused on connecting the back end with the front end - setting up the API and accessing it from the outside). Its functionality includes viewing the list of all posts, reading a post with all comments to it and adding a comment. It uses fetch with GET and POST methods.

I have used webpack in this project and plain HTML and CSS with no front-end frameworks.
